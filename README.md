# Fibonacci
Fibonacci Application Question for Swift Navigation

Problem:

In the programming language of your choice, write a program 
generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing ...
- ... "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
- ... "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
- ... "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
- ... the value F(n) otherwise.

Assumptions/Implementation
There were no instructions on what kind of variable to use for a Fibonacci 
series, so I used 'int'.  This limits the Fibonacci series to 47 numbers
before the value of 'int' rolls over.
